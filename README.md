This is the *Code-sharing Platform* project I made myself.


In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Show the same code snippet over and over in the API and the web interface
- Use POST requests to update the snippet and make the program display the time of the most recent update.
- Use the template engine FreeMarker to easily implement the latest snippets feed.
- Use a database to store all the code snippets.
- Implement a few access restrictions for the top-secret code snippets (time view limit and maximum view limit)
